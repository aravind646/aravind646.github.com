	<li>Learn to dance Salsa</li>
	<li>Skydiving from a plane</li>
	<li>Hot air ballon ride</li>	
	<li>Cook a decent full meal for a group of more than 5 people</li>
	<li>Go to Tomatina festival in Spain with friends</li>
	<li>Take my Grandma on a plane</li>
	<li>Run a marathon</li>
	<li>A good DSLR camera or something that is half decent of DSLR</li>
</ul>
