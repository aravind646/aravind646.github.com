I am a Computer Engineer and I code for a living. I did my Bachelors in Information Technology from <a href="http://www.annauniv.edu/">Anna University</a>. I have been working with <a href="http://www.ca.com/">CA Technologies</a> since June 2011. Apart from my work, I work on open source projects that interests me and I like traveling and exploring new places. You can take a look into my <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/">blog</a> and <a href="{{ site.url }}/bucket/">bucket list</a>.
